**The Agentic AI Foundation** **Charter**  
The Linux Foundation  
Effective Date: December 10, 2025

1) **Mission and Scope of the Agentic AI Foundation.** 

   1) The purpose of the Agentic AI Foundation (the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget and spend funds in support of the agentic AI projects supported by the Directed Fund following approval of such project(s) by the Governing Board (the “Technical Projects”), in accordance with the provisions of this Charter. The governance of each Technical Project is as set forth in the charter for that project. The foundation’s mission is to drive adoption and growth of open source agentic AI in the broader community.

   2) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-exempt status. 

   3) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund may also have a Technical Committee, Outreach Committee, and other working groups, councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be established by the Governing Board. These committees report to the Governing Board.

2) **Membership.**

   1) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Associate Members (each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed Fund as a member. All participants in the Directed Fund enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the Directed Fund may adopt with notice to members.

   2) Each Platinum Member will be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board and any Committee. At no time may there be more than eight (8) Platinum Members (the “Platinum Member Cap”). “Contributing Platinum Members” means those Platinum Members that have contributed at least one top-level Technical Project to the Directed Fund.

   3) The Gold Members will be represented on the Governing Board by one (1) representative from among the Gold Members. The Governing Board determines the nomination process and will select the Gold Member representative from among those nominees. The default term of a Gold Member representative shall be one year, but the Governing Board may modify the default term and may remove or replace the Gold Member representative prior to the end of their term by a two-thirds vote of the entire Governing Board, excluding the potentially removed Gold Member representative from quorum and voting calculations.

   4) Unless otherwise determined by the Governing Board, Silver Members shall not be entitled to appoint or elect representatives to the Governing Board or to any Committee of the Directed Fund, nor shall they have voting rights or participation rights in the governance of the Directed Fund beyond those expressly provided herein.

   5) The Associate Member category of membership is limited to Associate Members of The Linux Foundation. The Governing Board may set additional criteria for joining the Directed Fund as an Associate Member. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in the Directed Fund does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member. Associate Members shall not be entitled to appoint or elect representatives to the Governing Board or to any Committee of the Directed Fund, nor shall they have voting rights or participation rights in the governance of the Directed Fund beyond those expressly provided herein.

   6) Members will be entitled to:

      1) participate in Directed Fund general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and

      2) identify themselves as members of the Agentic AI Foundation supporting the Agentic AI Foundation community.

3) **Governing Board**

   1) The Governing Board voting members will consist of: 

      1) one representative appointed by each Platinum Member; and

      2) the selected Gold Member representative.

   2) Only one Member that is part of a group of Related Companies (as defined in Section 5\) may appoint, or nominate for a membership class election, a representative on the Governing Board. No single Member, company or set of Related Companies will be entitled to have more than one representative on the Governing Board.

   3) Conduct of Meetings

      1) Governing Board meetings will be limited to:

         1) the Governing Board representatives;

         2) approved guests; and

         3) LF staff. 

      2) Governing Board meetings follow the requirements for quorum and voting outlined in this Charter. The Governing Board may decide whether and under what conditions to allow named representatives (one per Member per Governing Board and per Committee) to attend as an alternate.

      3) The Governing Board meetings will be private unless decided otherwise by the Governing Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in consideration of specific Governing Board topics (but such guests may not participate in any vote on any matter before the Governing Board), provided no Governing Board voting member objects.

   4) Officers

      1) The officers (“Officers”) of the Directed Fund as of the first meeting of the Governing Board will be a Chairperson (“Chair”) and a Treasurer. Additional Officer positions may be created by the Governing Board.

      2) The Chair will preside over meetings of the Governing Board, manage any day-to-day operational decisions, and will submit minutes for Governing Board approval. The Chair must be a voting member of the Governing Board.

      3) The Treasurer will assist in the preparation of budgets for Governing Board approval, monitor expenses against the budget and authorize expenditures approved in the budget.

   5) The Governing Board will be responsible for overall management of the Directed Fund, including:

   3) Except as provided in Sections 5.e. and 13.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by vote at a meeting will require a simple majority vote, provided quorum is met. Except as provided in Sections 5.e. and 13.a. or elsewhere in this Charter, decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.

   4) In the event of a tied vote or stalemate with respect to an action that cannot be resolved by the Governing Board, the Chair or, during the Startup Period, any Contributing Platinum Member may refer the matter to the LF for assistance in reaching a decision. If there is a tied vote in any Committee that cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the Governing Board.

   5) At all times, the following actions require the approval of at least two-thirds of the entire Governing Board. In addition, starting on the Effective Date and for the three (3) years following the Effective Date (such period referred to as the “Startup Period”), the following actions also require the approval of all Contributing Platinum Members:

      1) an amendment of this Charter;

      1) “Subsidiaries” means any entity in which a Member owns, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in question;

      2) “Related Company” means any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member or which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in question; and

      3) “Related Companies” are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.
